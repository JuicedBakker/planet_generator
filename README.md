## The goal of this project

The goal is to showcase how one would approach terrain generation using a noise filter on a small scale. The method used is expandable but due to Processing being a lightweight tool, I've limited it to a small sphere.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download)
3. Open the .pde using the IDE you have just installed
4. Press the play button in the top left corner of the IDE.
5. When the application is loaded, press space bar to regenerate the terrain.
